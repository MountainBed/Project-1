# What's in Our Fridge?
A web app designed to help the hungry and tired; as well as the indecisive.

## Features
### Recipe Generation
The hungry participate selects three ingredients that they have access to and are willing to eat. The website will then use the Yummly Recipe API to produce 9 recipes that include these ingredients.

### Find a Restaraunt
Don't feel like cooking? That is fine! Select this option and the web app will produce a google map with nearby restaraunts marked for your convenience.
